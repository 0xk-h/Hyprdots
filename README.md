# Hyprdots

Raw Arch Linux + Hyprland dotfiles for my daily setup.

This repo is a personal collection of configs I actually use.  
It’s not clean, not stable, and not meant to be copied blindly.

Things change often. Some files may be outdated or incomplete.

Use at your own risk.

Includes Random scripts and experiments
